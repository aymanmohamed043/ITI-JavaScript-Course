5. Get the current page URL, protocol, and hostname using `location` and log them.
6. Use `history` to go back one page, then forward one page (write the code, don't actually run it).
7. Show the screen width and height in a div -change the div content- on the page.

DOM Traversal (Nodes, Elements, Collections)

11. Select the first `<ul>` in the document and log its `childNodes` and `children` properties. Explain the difference in a comment.
12. Write a function that logs the tag names of all direct child elements of `<body>`.
13. Given a parent element, loop through its `childNodes` and log only the nodes that are elements (not text/comments).
14. Use `firstChild` and `firstElementChild` on a container and explain the difference in a comment.
15. Write code to get all `<li>` elements inside a `<ul>` using `children` and explain the difference.
17. Write a function that logs all sibling elements of a given element (excluding itself).
18. Use `nextSibling` and `nextElementSibling` to traverse from the first child to the last child of a `<ul>`, logging each node.
19. Count how many element children a given node has (not using `children.length`).
20. Write a function that takes the first form element and logs the names and values of all its input fields using the `elements` collection.
21. Access all forms in the document using `document.forms` and log their names.
22. Access all images in the document using `document.images` and log their `src` attributes.
23. Write a function that takes a form and disables all its input fields using the `elements` collection.
24. Use `Array.from` to convert `document.images` to an array and filter images with width > 100px.
